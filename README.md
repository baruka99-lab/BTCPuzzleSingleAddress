This program generates Bitcoin key pairs in parallel using multiprocessing in Python. It continuously generates random secret exponents within a specified range, derives a private key, computes the compressed public key, hashes it to obtain the public key hash, adds a prefix for Bitcoin mainnet, calculates the checksum, and finally creates a Bitcoin address using base58check encoding.

The main purpose of the program is to search for a specific target Bitcoin address (target_address) and write the corresponding private key to a file (found.txt) if the target address is found.

Here's a description of the main components of the program:

Key Pair Generation Function (generate_key_pair):

Generates a random secret exponent.
Derives a private key using the secret exponent.
Computes the compressed public key.
Hashes the public key to obtain the public key hash.
Creates a Bitcoin address by adding the necessary prefixes and checksum.
Address Checking and Writing Function (check_and_write_address):

Checks if the generated Bitcoin address matches the target address.
If a match is found, writes the address and private key to a file (found.txt).
Multiprocessing:

Utilizes the multiprocessing module to create a pool of processes.
Distributes the generation of key pairs across multiple processes, each with a unique process ID.
Main Execution:

Determines the number of available CPU cores (cpu_count) and creates a pool of processes accordingly.
Defines the range for generating secret exponents (start_range to end_range).
Launches each process with a unique ID to generate key pairs concurrently.
Closes and joins the pool after the generation is complete.
Note:

The target Bitcoin address (target_address) is hardcoded, and if a matching address is found, the program writes the address and private key to the found.txt file.

Usage:
To use the provided program, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies:
Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

pip install ecdsa base58check

Clone the GitHub repository containing the program:

git clone <https://github.com/baruka99-lab/BTCPuzzleSingleAddress.git>
cd BTCPuzzSingleAdd
Modify Target Address (Optional):
Open the script (BTCPuzz.py) in a text editor and update the target_address variable to the Bitcoin address you want to search for.
Change the start_ranges and end_ranges to the ranges that correspond to the address of the puzzle you have chosen

Run the Program:
Execute the script using the following command:
python3 BTCPuzz.py
This will launch the program with multiple processes to generate Bitcoin key pairs concurrently.

Monitor Output:
The program will print information about the generated key pairs. If it finds a key pair matching the target address, it will print a message indicating the discovery and write the details to the found.txt file.

Check Output File:
If the target address is found, you can check the found.txt file for the corresponding private key and Bitcoin address.

Note:

Keep in mind that searching for a specific Bitcoin address using this method relies on the randomness of generated key pairs. It may take a significant amount of time to find a match.
Caution:

Ensure that you have a good understanding of the purpose and implications of the program, as it involves working with Bitcoin key pairs. Generating private keys randomly and searching for specific addresses should be done responsibly and ethically.
Remember to handle Bitcoin-related activities with caution and comply with legal and ethical standards.
